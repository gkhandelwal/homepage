# Biography

I am a second year Master's student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Minnesota,Twin Cities,USA. My research focuses on Distributed and Big Data systems. I am presently working on Stream Data Processing Engines, having a goal of achieving high accuracy (completeness) with low staleness of data.

I received my bachelors in Information Systems from Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences, Pilani, India in 2012. For my bachelor thesis, I was adviced by Prof. David S Rosenblum at National University of Singapore, where I worked on Designing and Implementing Publish/Subscribe Model in Declarative Language (NDlog) for content based overlay networks to improve efficiency, robustness and faster development. During my bachelors, I worked with Prof. Chittaranjan Hota on improving object lookup in unstructured overlay networks.
