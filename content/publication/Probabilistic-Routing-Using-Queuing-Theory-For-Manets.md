abstract = "Mobile ad-hoc networks pose real difficulty in finding the multihop shortest paths because of continuous changing positions of the nodes. Traditional ad-hoc routing protocols are proposed to find multi-hop routes based on shortest path routing algorithms, which cannot effectively adapt to time-varying radio links and network topologies of Ad-hoc networks. In this paper we proposed an enhanced routing algorithm, which uses probabilistic approach for the stability of the neighboring nodes in finding and maintaining the routing paths in Ad-hoc networks. The probability of a node being stable in the path is modeled by queuing theory, where the stability of a node is measured by number of packets arrived at a node and the number of packets being serviced by the node per unit time. Proposed approach shows significant improvement over the traditional Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol as analyzed in the result analysis section."
